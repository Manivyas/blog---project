                I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Developer - Intern position at Capgemini. As an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I have acquired comprehensive knowledge and practical experience in various areas of Computer Science and Engineering through my coursework and projects at my university. I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to the industry.
                I am particularly proud of my appointment as a Board Member and Project Head of the Soft Computing Research Society, a newly established club/chapter at my university, during the 2021-2022 term. This role provided me with valuable leadership experience and enhanced my ability to manage projects effectively.
                During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on core CFS team at Yubi, as a Full Stack Developer.
                I made significant contributions to the UI, including revamping the user interface, developing dynamic config-based filter and search components, creating tooltip and pagination functionalities, and implementing modal components.
                Additionally, on the backend, I was responsible for versioning APIs, managing logs, integrating New Relic services, and developing custom reports and repayment service modules.
                One of my recent achievements was adopting the Forest Admin Tool for the Custom Reports and Repayment Service within a sprint, which resulted in streamlining and enhancing the functionality of 50% of the CFS services.
                I am confident that my technical expertise, hands-on experience, and passion for innovation make me a strong candidate for Junior Developer - Intern position at Capgemini. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and collaborate on impactful projects.
                I look forward to the opportunity of discussing how my skills and experience align with the requirements of the role. Please find my attached resume for further details
